**Melanin Framework** is a simple open-source framework for creating custom blog sites or blog web apps. It is written in various languages to suit many development preferences or user preferences. It comes in two flavors:
- Colored - (Consists of both Frontend and Backend)
- Black and White - (Just Backend)
## Colored Flavor
The colored flavor consists of the frontend (admin panel and comes with two themes for your blog) and the backend. Deployment is made simple. A theme store will be available and will be supported by our developer community.

## Black and White Flavor
The black and white flavor ships with just the backend code. It is extensible and easy to customize.
